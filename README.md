### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m a recent graduate with a MCS degree at Rice University, Houston TX. I am actively looking for entry level software engineer opportunities.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am an uploader at [BiliBili](https://space.bilibili.com/8040375). I like playing games during my spare time. Sometimes, you may find me streaming games at [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/wdgotswag).
